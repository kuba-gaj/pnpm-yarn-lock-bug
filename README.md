## pnpm import from yarn.lock bug example

In `yarn.lock` we can see that `lib0` is a dependency of multiple packages:
- y-leveldb - depends on lib0@^0.2.31, resolved to lib0@0.2.41
- y-prosemirror - depends on lib0@^0.2.42, resolved to lib0@0.2.43
- y-protocols - depends on lib0@^0.2.42, resolved to lib0@0.2.43
- y-websocket - depends on lib0@^0.2.52, resolved to lib0@0.2.52
- yjs - depends on lib0@^0.2.49, resolved to lib0@0.2.52

In the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file generated by running `pnpm import` we can see that only `lib0@0.2.52` is used for all
dependencies
